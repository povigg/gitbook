# Bash Scripting

* script file has **.sh** extension
* **#!/bin/bash** - first line of the script, tell OS which program to use to run script
* to run script you need to give its full path like /opt/scripts/firstscript.sh
* use **> /dev/null** to redirect output from the screen (not to show clutter)
